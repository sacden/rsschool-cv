## Code Example

**Nickname Generator:** _Write a function, nicknameGenerator that takes a string name as an argument and returns the first 3 or 4 letters as a nickname. If the 3rd letter is a consonant, return the first 3 letters. If the 3rd letter is a consonant, return the first 3 letters. If the 3rd letter is a vowel, return the first 4 letters. If the string is less than 4 characters, return "Error: Name too short". Vowels are "aeiou", so discount the letter "y". Input will always be a string. Input will always have the first letter capitalised and the rest lowercase (e.g. Sam)_

```js
function nicknameGenerator(name) {
  const arr = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
  return name.length < 4 ? "Error: Name too short" : arr.includes(name.charAt(2)) ? name.split("").splice(0, 4).join("") : name.split("").splice(0, 3).join("");
}
```
